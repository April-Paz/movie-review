# Movie Review App

## About
My first backend project for my course. A website where users can sign up, review movies, and share their thoughts. Built with Node.js and Express.

## What It Does
- Users can sign up, log in, and stay logged in
- Browse and search movies
- Write reviews and rate movies
- Admin features to add movies (coming soon)

## Quick Start
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000



## Main Features
- Create account: POST /api/auth/register
- Log in: POST /api/auth/login  
- Browse movies: GET /api/movies
- Write review: POST /api/reviews (login required)

## About This Project
This is my first time building a complete backend application. I learned about user authentication with tokens, organizing code into modules, database connections, and API testing with Postman.

Some parts are still a work in progress, but I'm proud of what I've built so far.
